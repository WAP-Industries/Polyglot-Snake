## The Challenge
Code Snake, but the source code runs in both Python and C++.  
  
The languages must be independent of each other, meaning you can't do shit like in `gay-version.cpp`, where Python is relying on existing g++ capabilities to compile the c++ code.

---

## Compilation
- C++
    - Run `main.exe` or ...
    - Run `& .\compile.ps1` in your powershell terminal
- Python
    - Run `python main.cpp` in your terminal
